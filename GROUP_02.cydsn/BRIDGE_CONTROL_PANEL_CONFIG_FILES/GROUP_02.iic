; In the above part of this document, you can find 4 different blocks of code to be run in order to sample two analog sensors TMP and LDR.
; Select the block you want to run by selecting the number of samples (part A) and then by plotting the graph (part B)
; The different modalities among which the user can choose are:
; 1) LDR
; modality to sample only the values from the LDR sensor
; 2) TMP
; modality to sample only the values from the TMP sensor
; 3) LDR and TMP (LED modality = LDR)
; modality to sample values from both LDR and TMP sensors
; the LED intensity is modulated by the LDR sensor
; 4) LDR and TMP (LED modality = TMP)
; modality to sample values from both LDR and TMP sensors
; the LED intensity is modulated by the TMP sensor
; 5) None
; the device is stopped and no sensor is sampled

; NOTE: the LED intensity in case 1) and 2) is modulated by the active sensor; if the user - by mistake - tries to modulate the intensity using the
; the inactive sensor the internal blue LED will start blinking in order to warn the user.  
; When the device is stopped no graph is shown and no sample is considered.  

; To see all the possible combinations see "Group_2 - BCP combinations"
